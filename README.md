# The JupyterHub team compass

This meta-repository is meant to help us organize ourselves across the many organizations,
projects, and use-cases in the JupyterHub community. It's meant to make the project more
welcoming, transparent, and inclusive. If you've got an idea for how this can be improved,
please reach out!

Most of the Team Compass lives in this website:

* [The JupyterHub Team Compass](http://compass.hub.jupyter.org/)
* Please familiarise yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).
