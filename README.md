## Why have a Team Compass?

This repository helps the JupyterHub team and Binder team set a weekly
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans
- communication and culture of respectful teamwork
- recognitions and team celebrations

## We sail together.

While we value each others individual strengths and contributions, we succeed
or fail as a team. Whether taking corrective actions for a bug or being
recognized for good work, the team, instead of an individual, shoulders
the burden and success.

## Planning and operations

Currently, the JupyterHub team is keeping track of the goings-on in the community
via two main sources: a weekly team report and a monthly team meeting.

*Note: any member of the community is welcome to participate in any of the process around weekly reporting, archiving, and planning team meetings. Input is welcome!*

### Weekly Team Reports

The currently-active team report [exists in a HackMD](https://hackmd.io/MYNgpgHATAZgrAIwLQAYCMwAsTNhRJAThBQGYkoATEw0gQxgkroHYg==?view). Each week, team reports
are archived in the [weekly reports archive](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weekly-reports/weekly_report_index.html). Then, a new report is created with the [team report template](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weekly-reports/team-meeting.html).

* [Current week team report](https://hackmd.io/MYNgpgHATAZgrAIwLQAYCMwAsTNhRJAThBQGYkoATEw0gQxgkroHYg==?view)
* [Weekly report archive](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/tree/master/docs/weekly-reports)


### Team Meetings

Team meetings happen each month, and ideas for discussion etc are
farmed from the [weekly team reports](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weekly-reports/weekly_report_index.html) since the last meeting.  The contents / summary of each meeting are
archived in the [monthly meeting archive](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/monthly-meeting/monthly_report_index.html). [Meeting agenda template](https://hackmd.io/yLEoYgH8TcelS_EaXKJ6Hg?both).
