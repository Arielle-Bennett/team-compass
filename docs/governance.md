# Project Governance

The following sections describe governance and high-level principles
surrounding the JupyterHub and Binder projects.

The JupyterHub Project is a member of Project Jupyter, which is a fiscally
sponsored project of NumFocus, a US 501c3 non-profit. The Binder Project is a
subset of the JupyterHub Project.

## JupyterHub Project mission

The mission of the JupyterHub Project is to create, advance, and promote
open technology that enables interactive computing sessions via shared
infrastructure.

The JupyterHub Project pursues this mission by advancing the tools
surrounding JupyterHub, an open-source tool for hosting Jupyter
user sessions on shared infrastructure.

(binder-mission)=

## Binder Project mission

The mission of the Binder Project is to create, advance, and promote
open technology that makes it easy for people to connect their data
science communications, educational materials, and scientific work
with computational environments where their work can be run and
shared with others.

The Binder Project pursues this mission by advancing the tools
surrounding BinderHub, an open-source tool for hosting ad-hoc
environments in the cloud. The project also serves as the primary
maintainer of `mybinder.org`, a public service and demonstration of
the BinderHub technology.

## Membership

See {doc}`team/structure` as well as {doc}`team/index` for more information.

## How decisions are made

The JupyterHub Project team will make decisions [as colleagues] and by
attempting to reach consensus among team members (similar to a
[lazy consensus](http://en.osswiki.info/concepts/lazy_consensus) model that
encourages active participation from team members). If this is not
possible, then the team leader can use their power to make a decision.

There is currently no formal specification for this decision process.

## Modus operandi

All team business is conducted in public.
