# Milestones and roadmaps

A subset of JupyterHub projects organizes its releases and the
items associated with the release using GitHub Issues, Milestones, and in some cases, roadmaps.
These span from specific, actionable items, to more high-level goals of the project that
still require discussion.

In general, **Milestones** contain items that could use immediate help in
implementation and design, and we'd love community members to take a shot
at addressing them. **Roadmaps** tend to signal more abstract ideas, and
often require discussion before distilling them down into specific issues.

:::{note}
The JupyterHub roadmaps are run in a "yes, and" fashion. They are ideas
the community is excited about and would like to pursue or discuss further.
They are **not** meant to exclude other ideas or development (unless we
explicitly make a decision not to do something).

If you have an idea you'd like to propose, please open an issue or a pull
request to begin discussion. Over time, the roadmap should be updated as the
community interests and needs evolve.
