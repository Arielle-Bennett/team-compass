# Contributor resources

Resources and guides for team members to help us coordinate and work together more effectively.

**Contributor guide** is a resource for those interested in learning more about JupyterHub and how they can contribute to this project.

Our project depends on contributions from volunteers across the world who are interested in supporting the JupyterHub Project.
The sections below provide some resources to help you get started contributing to our community.
