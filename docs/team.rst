The JupyterHub Community
========================

There are lots of ways to contribute to the JupyterHub community.
Code, community interaction, documentation, bug testing, bug fixes, teaching,
proslytizing, etc...we recognize any and all contributions!

This page describes "self-described core" team members of the JupyterHub community.
These are people that spend a significant amount of their time contributing
to the projects and community under the JupyterHub umbrella.

Min Ragan-Kelley acts as the team lead for the JupyterHub organization.
