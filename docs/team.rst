====================
JupyterHub Core Team
====================

There are lots of ways to contribute to the JupyterHub community.
Code, community interaction, documentation, bug testing, bug fixes, teaching,
proslytizing, etc...we recognize any and all contributions!

This page describes "self-described core" team members of the JupyterHub
community. These are people that spend a significant amount of their
time contributing to the projects and community under the JupyterHub umbrella.

Note that these teams are accompanied by a much larger group of contributors
to Binder, JupyterHub, and Project Jupyter as a whole.

**If you'd like to be included in the teams below**:

* For JupyterHub, submit a pull request to add your name and information to
  the `JupyterHub team data <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/tree/master/docs/team/contributors-jupyterhub.yaml>`_
  YAML file.
* For Binder, check out the :ref:`team-membership` section of the
  :ref:`binder-governance` document for information about how you can join the
  Binder core team.

JupyterHub Team
---------------

The JupyterHub team is roughly comprised of two different projects with heavily-
overlapping team membership. Both are part of `Project Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_
and are developed by an open community of contributors.

The process and governance for both Binder and JupyterHub can be found in the
:ref:`jupyterhub-governance` :ref:`binder-governance` pages.

.. TODO: Update the governance page so that it isn't binder-specific

.. TODO: Include Binder / JupyterHub team focus in the HTML somehow

Here is the current JupyterHub/Binder team:

(listed alphabetically, with affiliation, and main areas of contribution)

Min Ragan-Kelley acts as the team lead for the JupyterHub organization.

Emoji keys
----------

You may notice that some of the team-members have "emojis" to reflect their
contributions in JupyterHub. These are from the `Kent Dodds "all contributors spec" <LINK>`_.
Below is a short table to show what each emoji represents.
