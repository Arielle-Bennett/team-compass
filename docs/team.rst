========================
The JupyterHub Community
========================

There are lots of ways to contribute to the JupyterHub community.
Code, community interaction, documentation, bug testing, bug fixes, teaching,
proslytizing, etc...we recognize any and all contributions!

This page describes "self-described core" team members of the JupyterHub community.
These are people that spend a significant amount of their time contributing
to the projects and community under the JupyterHub umbrella.

Min Ragan-Kelley acts as the team lead for the JupyterHub organization.

How can I be a part of these teams?
-----------------------------------

If you'd like to be included in any of the lists below, take the following steps:

1. Fork `the team-compass repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass>`_
2. Add your name and information to either the JupyterHub or the Binder team YAML files.
   Here are some links to the latest ones:

   * `BinderHub team data <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/tree/master/docs/team/contributors-binder.yaml>`_

3. Under the ``contributions:`` section, choose four words. If you choose
   words from the :ref:`emoji_keys` list, they'll be replaced with their emoji from
   from the `Kent Dodds all contributors list <https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key>`_.

4. Make a Pull Request to this repository! The table will be updated the next time the docs are built.
