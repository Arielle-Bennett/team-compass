# Merging and reviewing practices

This section describes the practices we follow when reviewing and merging one another's work.

## When should I merge a pull request?

As a team member, you're encouraged to help others contribute to the project
by reviewing their code, guiding them towards making a contribution and
improving it, and ultimately merging their contribution into the project.

Having merge rights is both a privilege and a responsibility - please be
thoughtful when using it! To that extent, here are a few guidelines when
deciding to merge things into one of our repositories:

* **Use your best judgment**. As a member of the JupyterHub teams, we trust
  your judgment, and we ask you to use your best judgment in deciding when to
  take an action.
* **Make sure it's quality code**. We know this is somewhat subjective, but
  ensure that the code is well-organized and thoughtfully-written, that any
  new features are documented, and that it abides by best-practices in Python,
  JavaScript, etc.
* **Make sure there are tests**. We try not to merge any new features (or
  bugfixes!) without adding tests for them. It's easy to consider something
  minor-enough that it doesn't warrant a test, but try to avoid doing this!
  Adding tests usually only takes a moment, and our future selves will thank
  us for it later.
* **Make sure there's been enough time for discussion**. We're an open
  community with an inclusive decision-making process. This means that
  sometimes we need to slow down to make sure others have a chance to
  review and provide their thoughts on changes. There's no hard rule for
  this, but try to make sure people have a chance to weigh in. Consider
  pinging people that you think might be interested in a question, and
  give it a few extra days before merging if you think a topic will be
  complex enough to warrant discussion.
* **Don't be afraid to merge!** We know this is a bit counter-intuitive
  given what we just said, but don't be afraid to merge new code. If you
  think a change is really complex or potentially controversial, give it
  some time, but for most changes it is fine to just go ahead and merge.
  Again, we trust your judgment, and we don't want these guidelines to become
  a burden that slows down development.
