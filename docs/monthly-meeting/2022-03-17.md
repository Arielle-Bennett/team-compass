## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- Congratulations to the latest JupyterHub [Jupyter Distinguished Contributor](https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-distinguished-contributors-bc349fa60d68) üéâ üöÄ ‚≠ê

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **Min (5m):** Adopting Jupyter governance nomenclature (rename "core team" "JupyterHub council" ) [issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/497)
  - Jupyter-wide governance restructure
  - There will be a "council" for each subproject, this is similar to our core team
  - We should align our terminology, but there's not much else to do
  - Maybe think about how our colour teams fit into this as well (maybe go to "active" or "inactive")
  - Check in with everyone give people opportunity to step-back if they wish
  - Check ins for active/inactive status: we should revisit that policy!
  - Emeritus members: honours their contributor but sounds more "distinguished"
  - We need a longer discussion on this, but definitely feels like the colour system is not having the desired effect
  - How do we not set the barrier too high for onboarding people to give them responsibilities without inducting them into a "council"?
- **Chris (10m?):** Funding situation with Binder, and plans for fundraising?
  - Our stop-gap funding from Google ran out in late February!
  - 2i2c covered the GKE bill for a few weeks, and it is currently funded by Simula
  - NumFocus created an account that we could use for donations:
  - Issue to discuss a stopgap fund for Binder: <https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/125>
  - Can we use multicluster spawner to scale certain clusters to zero?
    - Hub pod scaling would be an issue
  - An Azure/AWS cluster not owned by a specific institution would be helpful
  - Better separation between BinderHub on GKE and centralized analytics on GKE would help (federation-redirect, matomo, events archive)
  - Thanks Chris  for all the efforts on this front!
  - NumFocus now has a link for donating to Binder: <https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-binder>
  - **Callum** turing status:
    - turing funding currently ran out, and turing's involvement in the cluster has been paused (<https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/495>)
    - current request under discussion would give us capacity to support 200 pods + staging cluster (i.e. the situation before pausing).
    - in discussions to reserve instances for 3 years
- **Yuvi (10m?):** Collaborate with jupyter notebook community in making sure JupyterHub is ready for the notebook v7 transition
  - <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/10>
  - Should we be able to run the 'new' notebook v7 UI and old classic notebook UI in the same JupyterHub?
    - Just the *UI* - similar to `nbclassic` now, not the whole server.
    - Often multiple courses / instructors use the same hub, and need different UIs.
    - *Currently*, it is not possible to use the new UI and old classic notebook UI side-by-side in the same JupyterHub
  - Please chime in on the Issue
  - Note: Classic UI has been a contentious issue in our community, so please be even more thoughtful than usual when engaging :)
  -
- **Yuvi (5m?):** Preparing nbgitpuller for notebook v7
  - nbgitpuller currently fundamentally depends on classic notebook assets being present to work - to get CSS & JS
    - This is an accidental complexity, can / should be fixed.
    - Currently, it will just break in weird ways if notebook package is not installed
  - Need to decide on what the behavior would be for *existing* links that point to classic notebook, related to point above
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FAZj2Yf.png)
  - While we're here, would appreciate review on <https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/pull/255>
  - Community idea: JupyterHub admin's guide to notebook v7 (e.g. as a blog)
