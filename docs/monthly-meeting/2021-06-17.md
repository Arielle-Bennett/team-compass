## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- Erik & 1.0!

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **Erik Sundell** JupyterHub Helm chart 1.0.0-beta.1 / 1.0.0
- **Isabela Presedo-Floyd** (10 min) What's the status on [binderhub #1287](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1287)? What can I do to support a solution for the communities blocked by the bad ([comments on the original issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/issues/1828))
  - Issue for context: <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1287>
  - Alternate PR: <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1309>
  - Supply build token for requests that come from our pages (not the `/build` API) and exclude requests that don't have this token
  - Work towards all federation members signing/reading JWTs
- **Samuel Gaist** JupyterHub for a reproducible research platform ([more context](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyterhub-for-a-reproducible-research-platform/9515?u=sgaist))
  - Hook in kubespawner that allows you to modify the pod that's about to be launch before it's launched (?)
  - **Yuvi** <https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/blob/0da771b25dccfc277c95b175065e3080531854bb/hub/values.yaml#L187> not my code, please don't judge (_copied from chat_)
  - Many things can be set as Callables, rather than values, so can be modified for specific users
  - Multi-authentication paradigm: remote user auth, lightweight authenticator that only accepts requests that originate from your ingress point, get username from a header set by that proxy, make another API request to get further info
  - Jupyter Enterprise Gateway: you have a notebook server, and now you want to launch **one** notebook in an evironment
- **Min RK** (5m) repo2docker conda-lock and micromamba
  - conda-lock <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1024>
    - Simplifies freeze step, faster builds
    - conda-lock only works with conda packages, no pip. solution is to make the pip install a separate step (with separate requirements.txt)
    - Review requested
  - micromamba <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1038>
    - should save time, related to package installs
    - no longer need to bootstrap a root env for the notebook server. Instead, download a single binary file.
      - right now we create a root environment, then another one for the notebook server and maybe another for a kernel (e.g. Python 2)
  - may cause conflicts since they both touch package installs
  - what are our promises about conda/mamba availability to users?
    - micromamba can install both conda and mamba
    - Tim thinks providing a `conda` executable out of the box makes sense for backwards compatibility/least surprise
- **Min RK** (10m) roles and scopes are ready for main: <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/3438>
  - Review requested
- **Yuvi** (5m) Common Grafana Dashboards for JupyterHub https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-grafana
  - **Min** this sounds amazing!
