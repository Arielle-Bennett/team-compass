## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- Tim - miners :D ![](https://i.imgur.com/cuQkYLo.png)
- Erik - Simon have made a lot of work to make the JupyterHub ecosystem arm64 compatible, so RaspberryPI computers etc can be used!!
  - Z2JH images, CHP image, JupyterHub image, jupyter/docker-stacks etc

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- Gerhard Br√§unlich (10min):
  - [PR 1169](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1169) -- Allow dynamic repository credentials for authenticated Binderhub instances.
    - Could this provide a git ref from the cache to someone who is not authenticated?
  - [PR 1255](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1255) -- Proxy Support for the build pod
    - Simon to test
  - Automated deployment/testsould be nice
  - Docs on how to test would also be nice!
    - maybe in the form of a "tutorial" in the docs on how to use it
  - Action point: arrange a meeting to discuss how authenticated binderhubs work
- Tim [10min] - new entrypoint in repo2docker
  - Original PR <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1014>
  - Follow up issues
    - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/issues/1030>
    - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/issues/1033>
  - should we try and make a coordianted effort to look at and deal with the various issues that have been opened related to this?
  - I don't know much about them, just seen several appear in my notifications
  - Looks like they are more "annoying" than critical bugs. We should get around to fixing them but not blocking people right now.
- Mridul [2 min] - Interest in merging [persistent_binderhub](https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub) with upstream?
  - Would close <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/377>
  - lots of people request/want this when they think about running a BinderHub for their organisation
  - Would be a new PR, ping @g-braeunlich
  - Support for this, ensuring that the knowledge to use and test is brought into the team
- Yuvi [5min] - Demo of notebook publishing with ipynb.pub
  - Fastest way to publish notebooks on the web
  - Upload notebook (lab / notebook extensions soon), share link with anyone
  - Opt-in annotations with hypothes.is
  - Jupytext supported
  - [Example with Annotations from Leah](https://ipynb.pub/view/eac8fe9fe71b355c79edf0c719a4546ae73b0ebfbbf39ff5e3e7225a43d5d1ca#displayOptions=enable-annotations)
  - Help wanted: Useful to run as a JupyterHub service
  - Question: Authentication?
  - some cross over/useful to talk about when thinking about the "standby pods" idea in BinderHub
    - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/1167>
    - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/812>
    - an interesting question is how to pull in the extra file into one of these "standby pods"
  - URL support for nbgitpuller - get a repo vs see a notebook
  - Git repo: <https://github.com/ipynb-pub/ipynb.pub>
- Tim [5min] - GitLab docker registry problems
  - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/search?o=desc&q=gitlab+is%3Apr&s=updated&type=issues>
  - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1282>
  - this looks easy but somehow turns out to be tricky. Does anyone who has access to a GitLab registry have experience here?
  - needs experience with existing dockerhub support, gcr.io as well as gitlab support
  - Gerhard to contribute some of his expertise
