The JupyterHub team also used to keep weekly reports for what they had
been up to. We recently switched to Monthly sync-ups instead of weekly
reports, but below is a list of the weekly reports that we have put together.

Updating the team meeting agenda
================================

The JupyterHub team uses HackMD to keep track of its meeting agenda before and
during each monthly meeting. Here's the process we follow around the JupyterHub
team meeting:

1. The meeting agenda always lives `at this HackMD
   <https://hackmd.io/u2ghJJUCRWK-zRidCFid_Q?view>`_.
2. At the beginning of a
   monthly cycle, copy/paste `this agenda template
   <https://hackmd.io/yLEoYgH8TcelS_EaXKJ6Hg?both>`_ into it
3. Before the meeting,
   the community fills in **agenda items** they'd like to cover, as well as
   **shoutouts** for activity in the community.
4. Throughout the meeting, the
   agenda is filled out with new items, notes, discussion points, and action
   items.
5. After the meeting, the agenda contents are copy/pasted into a new markdown
   file in the `monthly meeting folder
   <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/tree/master/docs/monthly-meeting>`_
   and added to the team-compass repository in a PR
6. The `meeting agenda HackMD <https://hackmd.io/u2ghJJUCRWK-zRidCFid_Q?view>`_
   should then be erased and replaced
   with a fresh `team meeting
   template <https://hackmd.io/yLEoYgH8TcelS_EaXKJ6Hg?both>`_.
