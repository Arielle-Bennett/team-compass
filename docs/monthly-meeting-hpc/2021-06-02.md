## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- Standing Items:
    - Batchspawner check-in
        - Some new issue arising, need to review and understand if those are new or come from having a release (attention)
        - MM will look through the issues and see what to do
    - Wrapspawner check-in
        - At last call, goal was release, then deep dive on issues
        - What are the top issues?
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/issues/41
                - With pull request: https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/pull/45
        - We need testing!
            - Frameworks for testing?
            - Pull requests welcomed!
            - Open an issue with a help-wanted tag, ask folks to contribute to that
- **Shreyas** Jupyter RTC - Collaborative Notebook Editing
    - How does this impact HPC / Multiuser deployments and security? References:
        - https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc
        - https://jupyterlab-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - It's running a process owned by one user on the back end
    - Everyone attached can see all the first owner's goodies (env, files, etc)
        - Some precedent for shared remote desktops especially for support at some places
        - Other places not
        - Possibly through special users like collab/project users
        - Are there guardrails we can put in place?
    - How to know who did what in a shared notebook/provenance?
    - Next step they are working on is how to get people to auth at the hub
    - Demo: https://github.com/firasm/RTC_test
    - Analogies to Overleaf/ShareLatex, Google Docs
    - Containers can help possibly share only a subset of what you want to share
    - Restrict to restricted container environments?
    - Communicate requirements upwards!
        - Otherwise "it works in Binder good to go"
        - How to do the communicating?
            - There's a monthly call around RTC, people are encouraged to participate
            - https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc#project-meetings
    - To test there is a requirements file, it's in 3.1a, just add `--collaborative` I think
- **Zach** How are folks handling "too many options" in Batch/Wrap/Profiles?
    - Do users just have to use lots and lots of menus
        - Rollin showed some preset stuff
        - A service alongside the hub for managing user preferences
        - Intern will come to a future meeting to show his extension of this
    - **Jens** Having groups
        - Beside the login button there's groups as a feature
        - This simplifies things like user training events or hackathons
        - Leveraging groups lets you have some presets
