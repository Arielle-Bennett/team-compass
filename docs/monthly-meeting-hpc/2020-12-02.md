## Quick updates

60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. This is also a chance to suggest a future presentation if you've got work currently in progress you might want to share. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

- **NAME:** What you'd like to update on
- **Rollin:** Notes from last meeting on team-compass, PR/issue
- **Kevin:** Hit another sysadmin blocking issue at NCAR, does anyone have interest in setting up a "mock HPC system" on AWS or GCP or otherwise for dev/testing of JupyterHub-based services?  (e.g., Binder for HPC and more)  If yes, then we can discuss below.
  - For another local test, I [name=rkdarst] used https://github.com/giovtorres/docker-centos7-slurm (also https://github.com/giovtorres/slurm-docker-cluster for multi-container)
  - +1
  - For more elaborate setup, have a look at Magic Castle: https://github.com/computecanada/magic_castle which can setup a Slurm cluster + JupyterHub in AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenStack
- **Félix-Antoine:** Where are we with batchspawner PR #187 - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/187 ?
- **Michael:** Worked out the kinks in the CI for batchspawner, and there's a release out on PyPI.  Never had a wrapspawner release on PyPI but Michael is look at getting that out on PyPI (make sure no issues, `setup.py` works etc)
    - Richard: Made an action to check tag against version in the package to make sure they are the same.  Seems like a common need, useful in his case.
