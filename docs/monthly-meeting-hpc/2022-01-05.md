    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/issues/44
        - Having to vivify the `self.child_spawner.server`
        - Action:
            - Add comment to the fix
            - Merge the PR, close related issues
            - Open issue on the line saying we should consider a better fix
        - 1.0.1 release in light of #45?
            - Last release was April/May
