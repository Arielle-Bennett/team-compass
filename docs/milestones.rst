Milestones and roadmaps
=======================

A subset of JupyterHub projects organizes its releases and the
items associated with the release using GitHub Issues, Milestones, and in some cases, roadmaps.
These span from specific, actionable items, to more high-level goals of the project that
still require discussion.

In general, Milestones contain items that could use immediate help in implementation and design, and
we'd love community members to take a shot at addressing them. Roadmaps tend to signal more
abstract ideas, and often require some discussion before distilling them down into specific issues.
We also encourage comments, questions, ideas in this process! 

Below are links for the upcoming **milestones** and **roadmaps** in several repositories.
