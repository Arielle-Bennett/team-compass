JupyterHub Project Governance
=============================

The following sections describe governance and high-level principles
surrounding the JupyterHub Project.

The JupyterHub Project is a member of Project Jupyter, which is a fiscally
sponsored project of NumFocus, a US 501c3 non-profit.

Project mission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mission of the JupyterHub Project is to create, advance, and promote
open technology that enables interactive computing sessions via shared
infrastructure.

The JupyterHub Project pursues this mission by advancing the tools
surrounding JupyterHub, an open-source tool for hosting Jupyter
user sessions on shared infrastructure.

.. _jupyterhub-team-membership:

Membership
~~~~~~~~~~

Membership in the JupyterHub Project is open to anyone who is nominated by
an existing member. Members form the trusted group of individuals who
manage the JupyterHub Project.

Membership comes with `privileges`_ and `responsibilities`_.

The authoritative list of members and their roles (alphabetical sorting)
can be found at the :ref:`jupyterhub-team` section.

Team privileges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  recognition
-  team members can speak for the project in public
-  merge privileges on the project repositories
-  nominating other individuals to team membership

.. _jupyterhub-team-responsibilities:

Team responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JupyterHub team responsibilities are outlined in the
`JupyterHub team member guide <https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team/member-guide.html>`_.

Team roles
~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Team leader.** This is a person who has impasse-breaking authority to
   make decisions if the team can not agree. This authority should
   be used exceedingly sparingly. The team leader is expected to grow
   team members so that they can pass on their position to them.
-  **Team member.** You spend a large part of your time coordinating and
   promoting the JupyterHub Project, helping new contributors learn and
   grow within the community, and contribute to the JupyterHub repositories.
   You are expected to prepare and attend the monthly team calls on a
   semi-regular basis. We expect team members to teach and grow
   contributors that can join the team. This encourages diversity
   of the team.
-  **Green member.** Your life situation has changed so that you prefer to
   (temporarily) not take on the rights and responsibilities of being an
   active member. You can return to active membership by resuming your
   community activities. Your return will be announced at the next monthly
   team meeting.

There are no other specific roles, but we may revisit this in the
future.

A note on team membership over time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being a team member is not a life sentence. We
expect team members to teach and grow other members so that they can
pass their organizational responsibilities on to them. This encourages
us to increase diversity, reduce burn-out and allow team members to
shift their focus in reaction to changing life circumstances.

We ask that team members commit themselves in ~6 month cycles for new
team members, and for shorter cycles if you are transitioning from the
green team. If at any time a team member feels that they would
like to take a break from active team membership, they're can choose
to join the "green team" by making a
pull request to the `JupyterHub team membership <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/blob/master/docs/team/contributors-jupyterhub.yaml>`_
or `Binder team membership <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/blob/master/docs/team/contributors-binder.yaml>`_
files.

How decisions are made
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JupyterHub Project team will make decisions `as colleagues`_ and by
attempting to reach consensus among team members (similar to a
`lazy consensus <http://en.osswiki.info/concepts/lazy_consensus>`_ model that
encourages active participation from team members). If this is not
possible, then the team leader can use their power to make a decision.

There is currently no formal specification for this decision process.

Team size
~~~~~~~~~

There is no limit to the size of the team.

There is no hard cap on the number of senior members that can exist,
though this will be re-evaluate if the group becomes big enough to be
unwieldy. We see the ideal number of red team members to be around 6-10
people.

Modus operandi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All team business is conducted in public.
