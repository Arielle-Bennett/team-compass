Binder Project Governance
=========================

The following sections describe governance and high-level principles
surrounding the Binder Project.

The Binder Project is a member of Project Jupyter, which is a fiscally
sponsored project of NumFocus, a US 501c3 non-profit.

Project mission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mission of the Binder Project is to create, advance, and promote
open technology that makes it easy for people to connect their data
science communication, education, and scientific reproducibility work
with computational environments which can run their work.

The Binder Project pursues this mission by advancing the tools
surrounding BinderHub, an open-source tool for hosting ad-hoc
environments in the cloud. The project also serves as the primary
maintainer of ``mybinder.org``, a public service and demonstration of
the BinderHub technology.

Membership
~~~~~~~~~~

Membership in the Binder Project is open to anyone who is nominated by
an existing member. Members form the trusted group of individuals who
manage the Binder Project.

Membership comes with `privileges`_ and `responsibilities`_.

Currently, the Binder Project team overlaps 100% with `the BinderHub
team`_. However, these two groups may diverge in their membership over
time.

The authoritative list of members and their roles (alphabetical sorting):
* Tim Head (red)
* Min Ragan-Kelley (team leader)
* Yuvi Panda (red)
* Erik Sundell (blue)
* Carol Willing (red)
* Your Name (red or blue)

Team privileges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  recognition
-  team members can speak for the project in public
-  merge privileges on the project repositories
-  red members can nominate other individuals to team membership

Team responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each member of the Binder Project team is expected to spend a
"reasonable" (intentionally vague) amount of time contributing to the
technology used by Project Binder as well as maintaining
``mybinder.org``. This might mean contributing features, making patches,
responding to issues, reviewing PRs, teaching about BinderHub, making
organizational connections, welcoming new contributors, or evangelizing
and helping others deploy BinderHub. They should be receptive to
comments and ideas on the GitHub issues or in the Binder gitter channel.
They should strive to make project decisions that reflect these
community opinions.

This list is non-complete.

Team roles
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Team leader. This is a person who has impasse-breaking authority to
   make decisions if the team can not agree. This authority should
   be used exceedingly sparingly. The team leader is expected to grow
   team members so that they can pass on their position to them.
-  Red member. You spend a large part of your time coordinating and
   promoting the Binder Project as well as the service at
   ``mybinder.org``. You are expected to coordinate your actions with
   other red members so that the project presents a coherent position
   towards the outside. You are expected to prepare and attend the
   monthly team calls. Being a red member is not a life sentence. We
   expect red members to teach and grow other members so that they can
   pass their organizational responsibilities on to them. This encourages
   is to increase diversity, reduce burn-out and allow team members to
   shift their focus in reaction to changing life circumstances.
-  Blue Member. This is where the journey of a new team member starts.
   You spend a large
   part of your time facilitating contributions from others to the
   project (e.g. reviewing work, answering questions, maintaining
   project infrastructure). We expect blue members to teach and grow
   contributors that can become blue members. This encourages diversity
   of the team. After building a good understanding of the technology
   and social structure of the project you can change to a red member by
   volunteering for tasks which a red member is expected to perform.
   After a while of doing so the team will ask if you want to become a
   red member and, if you agree, recognise you as such at a monthly team
   meeting.

There are no other specific roles, but we may revisit this in the
future.

How decisions are made
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Binder Project team will make decisions `as colleagues`_ and by
attempting to reach consensus among team members. If this is not
possible, then the team leader can use their power to make a decision.

There is currently no formal specification for this decision process.

Team size
~~~~~~~~~

There is no limit to the size of the team.

There is no hard cap on the number of senior members that can exist,
though this will be re-evaluate if the group becomes big enough to be
unwieldy. We see the ideal number of senior members to be around 6-10
people.

Modus operandi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All team business is conducted in public.
