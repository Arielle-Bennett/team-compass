# Team meetings and notes

The JupyterHub community meets periodically to discuss important issues, make decisions, share ideas, and enjoy one another's company.

These meetings - called Collaboration Cafés - are fully remote and open to anyone, particularly those who are interested in joining the community!

## Meeting calendars

There are two meeting calendars worth following:

- [**The JupyterHub meeting calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=aqpkui5q7oi32pk9tcp53hnssc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles): meeting times for the JupyterHub community.
- [**The Jupyter meeting calendar**](https://jupyter.org/community#calendar): meeting times for all sub-communities within Jupyter.

The JupyterHub meeting calendar is embedded below for quick reference:

## Meeting notes

The JupyterHub team hosts regular Collaboration Cafés (see [](meetings:calendars)).

We open an issue for each meeting using the ["Schedule a Collaboration Cafe"](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/new/choose) GitHub issue template.

We use [this framapad](https://mypads2.framapad.org/p/jupyterhub-jupyterbook-collaborationcafe-nr53am9wz) to take collaborative notes.
Framapads are screen-reader accessible and robust to multiple people typing at the same time.

We rotate time zones for each meeting to ensure that there is a timezone-friendly meeting for anybody in the world at least once every two months.

## Notes for HPC working group

## Archive of past meeting types

The JupyterHub team used to keep monthly and weekly reports for what they had been up to.
The notes archives are linked from [weekly-reports](weekly-reports) and [community](community).

There was also an HPC working group met monthly to discuss JupyterHub deployment on HPC systems and the various software projects supporting those efforts.
Those notes are linked from [hpc](hpc).
