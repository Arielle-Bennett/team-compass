Team meetings and notes
=======================

The JupyterHub community meets periodically to discuss important issues, make decisions, share ideas, and enjoy one another's company.
These meetings are open to anyone, particularly those who are interested in joining the community!

Below are links to the notes from each of these meetings over the last several
months.

Monthly meetings
================

The JupyterHub team has a project-wide video meeting each month (see calendar).
We use [this HackMD for notes and agenda-setting](https://hackmd.io/@sgibson91/hubs-team-meeting).

We rotate time zones for each meeting to ensure that there is a timezone-friendly meeting for anyboyd in the world at least once every two months.

Notes archive
=============

The JupyterHub team used to keep weekly reports for what they had
been up to. We recently switched to Monthly sync-ups instead of weekly
reports, but below is a list of the weekly reports that we have put together.
