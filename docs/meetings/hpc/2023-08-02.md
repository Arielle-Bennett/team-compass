## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in, issues and PRs
        - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/273 (bump minimum to python 3.7)
        - Review after PEARC 
    - Wrapspawner check-in, issues and PRs
        - Mentioned in discourse thread
        - But no repo action this month
    - Discourse:
        - HPC-related projects topic <- Rollin (done)
            - Batchspawner, wrapspawner
            - jupyter-lmod
            - jupyterhub-announcement
            - jupyter-slurm-provisioner
        - Census of deployments, what versions are people running? <- Mike
- Workshop/conference news:
    - PEARC 2023 debrief
        - Open OnDemand has a very large presence
        - Should NumFOCUS have a presence at PEARC?
        - Vendors supporting OnDemand signs
        - Displacing JupyterHub
        - Michael's team had a poster up comparing Hub + OOD:
            - Not many institutions with both deployed
            - OOD deployed to explore moving away from virtual desktops
            - Jupyter could do much of this too but is container first
            - OOD just worked in their tests
            - If you want purpose-built HPC support, OOD is good
            - JupyterHub is more flexible architecturally
            - Want to mix+match HPC + cloud/cloud-like resources JupyterHub may be better
            - Might be able to construct more sophisticated security regimes w/JupyterHub for Jupyter specifically
            - Overall Jupyter is very interesting to people doing HPC
            - Instances of JupyterHub being used for cloud-oriented resources, more clever things w/tokens than OOD
            - Will have a link to the poster once ACM posts
    - TrustedCI Summit at LBL, week of October 23
        - October 24-26
        - Security subproject + Zeek
            - Security training
