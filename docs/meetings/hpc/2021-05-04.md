## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- SDSC Jupyter Proxy Service
    - Project is called "Satellite"
    - Jupyter initially appeared as "plain-text back door into the cluster"
    - "Make the right things easier than the wrong things"
    - Satellite:
        - Invoke client, get URL, notebook shows up
        - Self-service https reverse-proxy
        - Shell-based utility to orchestrate RP and Slurm
        - https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/satellite
    - Reverse proxy:
        - RP provides SSL termination
        - users create/destroy mappings
        - short-lived random subdomains
        - satellite api only usable by wget/curl
        - https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/reverse-proxy
    - start-jupyter, Galyleo:
        - Batch jobs, issues with templates and integrating Singularity
        - Open OnDemand portal on Expanse (have Matlab, RStudio, want to integrate Satellite)
        - Galyleo repo: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/satellite
    - --transport=ipc
    - Streetwise guide: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X_0hHYpQcCwrwbPMGSHuTeys7KPW3bC1/edit#slide=id.g8cad2b19f4_0_1024
    - Shane is trying it on expanse during the call :)
    - Questions:
        - What proxy service are you using (traefik, CHP?)
            - Looks like it is dynamically configuring apache
        - Is their an open repo for the API? (Answered)
        - Is there any user documentation?  I couldn't quickly find it via Google. (Answered)
            - https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo
        - Rather obvious one: Hub enables subdomains, provides proxy; what were the issues w/Hub that made you think you needed your own approach?
            - Already have trust established (Q: e2e SSL)
            - Issues local to SDSC when starting w/Hub
            - Want to prevent users from running Jupyter themselves full stop (if they go around Hub)
            - Concern about where hub lives with respect to trust boundary of cluster, can be addresses
        - Slides available? distributable?
            - yes, and yes
- Standing Items:
    - Batchspawner check-in
        - Need to check in with outstanding PRs now that autoformat PR is merged, will need to rebase
    - Wrapspawner check-in
        - At last call, goal was release, then deep dive on issues
        - What are the top issues?
    - JupyterLab 3 deployment news
        - NERSC
            - Pushed back to May 19 at NERSC but will happen
            - ~All needed extensions are working now
            - One [issue](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/issues/495) found and fixed in jupyter_server
