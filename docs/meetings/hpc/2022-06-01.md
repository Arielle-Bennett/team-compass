## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - need to check CI status, seems to be failing for PRs, from March (this was fixed in April):
            - pytest run for 3.9 against hub 0.9.6 fails
            - using a deprecated sqlalchemy maybe pinned by hub
            - Plan: drop that combo from the matrix, rerun
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/229
            - Will probably unblock other failed PR tests
        - Worthwhile to do a sweep on batchspawner PRs
            - Which are worth keeping which to close?
            - Plan: Mike will take a look on PRs
        - Some new pull requests
        - Users have been breaking batchspawner by overwriting the script template
            - Created issue to not encourage users to do this
            - Documentation issue, not code issue
            - Some better config examples for README (they're old)
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - EPA team contribution PR - Michael did code review, would like to see some restructuring but support accepting with cleanup
            - Code review by MM yesterday
            - Some restructuring described in response
            - Derived from ProfileSpawner
- Workshop/conference season:
    - ISC 22 Interactive HPC
