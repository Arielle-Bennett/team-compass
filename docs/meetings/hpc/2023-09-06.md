- **Name:** Your report or celebration
-  Cory Sherman
    -  Difficulties for iterative improvements with the hub secrets file, still using 2.0.0
        -  Having to rebuild helm chart every time
        -  Mridul, Rick may have some suggestions on secrets
    -  Global image repo setting in 3.0.0?
        -  Maybe check in with JupyterHub team on their call?
- Félix-Antoine Fortin:
    - We had to debug 504 error in Jupyter notebooks running from a Lustre HOME. Turns out we had to fix 4 different things to fix bad user experience.
    - Planning to write a blog post of sort about that and I am wondering if anyone had similar issues.
    - Fixes were : 
        - moving IPython history database in memory
        - moving Jupyter server signature database in memory
        - moving Jupyter runtime directory to SLURM_TMPDIR (it's no longer XDG_RUNTIME_DIR since 2019...)
        - disabling FileManagerMixin use_atomic_writing (https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jupyter_server.services.contents.html#jupyter_server.services.contents.fileio.FileManagerMixin.use_atomic_writing)
    - Used strace then went to pyspy for RCA
    - Discourse post encouraged by all
- Rollin: If we have time I can tell you about misconfigured MTUs and bad optical connections that Jupyter found
    - I now ping every Jupyter notebook running every 30s to catch timeouts and 504 storms
    - DVS woes
    - GPFS woes

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.
