        - Enforce periodic login

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - Current release
            - Minor point release?  Yes, 1.2 in progress
            - Year of accumulated changes
            - Mike will go ahead
        - Test matrix outdated
            - Currently targets JH 0.9.6 through 1.3 only
            - Will start PR - add your tag here if you would like to be @-ed 
                - @rcthomas
                - @ryanlovett
            - Python versions discussion
                - currently propose supporting 3.6 and newer
                - current JHub only supports 3.7+
            - Batchspawner version numbering
                - 1.x supports back to JHub 1.x
        - PRs to review:
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/245
                - let's add a req_nodes trait that defaults to 1
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/219
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/218
                - converse with proposer to see if this has been useful, having ability to inject a command here seems useful even if actual scheduler output typically isn't realistic

                - question about using internal hub api, `HubAuth._api_request`
