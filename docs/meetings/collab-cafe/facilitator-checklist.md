# Facilitator Checklist for Collaboration CafÃ©s

This document provides a list of actions for a facilitator to take, and when, when running a Collaboration CafÃ©.

All links for running the meeting will be in a GitHub issue that should be created [after the previous meeting](collab-cafe:facilitator-checklist:after).

## Before the Meeting

### 1 week before:

- Post a comment on the issue in the Team Compass repo reminding folk that the meeting is one week away.
  - Ask for breakout topics and celebrations.
  - Identify "breakout chairs" to lead specific topic discussions.
- Share the issue on the [Jupyter Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com).
- Promote the meeting in any other spaces you would like (LinkedIn, BlueSky, Mastodon, user community slack workspaces etc).
- Add an ice breaker question to the framapad
  - Google can help you find one ðŸ˜„, such as [these](https://www.mtu.edu/student-leadership/student-orgs/rso-resources/virtual-resources/fun-icebreaking-questions.pdf), [these](https://toggl.com/blog/icebreaker-questions), or [all of these](https://museumhack.com/list-icebreakers-questions/).

### 1 day before:

- Post a comment on the issue in the Team Compass repo reminding folk that the meeting is the next day
  - Ask for breakout topics and celebrations.
  - Confirm with the "breakout chairs" that they are able to attend and lead specific topic discussions.
- Remind folks on the [Jupyter Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com).
- Promote the meeting in any other spaces you would like (LinkedIn, BlueSky, Mastodon, user community slack workspaces etc).

## During the Meeting

- Welcome everyone and remind them that the meeting is being held under [Jupyter's Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
- Encourage attendees to sign their name into the shared document and answer the ice breaker question.
- Draw attendee's attention to the existing lists of celebrations and agenda items and ask if there are additional ones they'd like to discuss.
- Encourage everyone to contribute to note taking, reminding them that good notes allows for knowledge exchange across breakout rooms, and includes community members who are not able to join at this particular time.
- Work your way through the shared document, starting with intros and celebrations before moving into the main agenda
    - Try to get folks into breakout rooms as quickly as is reasonable.
      Don't rush the celebrations but if a focused discussion starts try to hold it until the breakout rooms are open.
    - If there are discussion topics in the main room, try to keep an eye on timing so that all the topics can be covered without overrunning.
      This may mean interrupting some discussions and suggesting they be continued asynchronously (Zulip, Discourse, or GitHub are good places to point folk to).
    - Make sure to leave time for any questions before moving into the next agenda item.
- To close out the meeting, thank everyone for attending and remind them of the date of the next meeting.
