### Introductions

- **Kirstie** Not really new to the meeting but a new job for 2025 - I'm now the executive director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, working with Fernando Perez as Faculty Director. We're VERY excited about contributing into the Jupyter ecosystem :rocket: 
- **Arielle** Hi, I'm Arielle, senior researcher for open source practices at Turing. Interested in looking at open source contributions, communities, and technical support. I also contribute to The Turing Way which has close links with Jupyter! 
- **Maryam** Hi, I'm Maryam, and I serve as the CTHO at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), working very closely with Fernando Perez. I'm also the Managing Director of Agile Metabolic Health Inititave at UC Berkeley College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), developing JupyterHealth which is being considered to be a subproject of JupyterHub (VERY exciting). We're thrilled about the opportunity to become more involved and contribute to the JupyterHub ecosystem moving forward.
- **Yijun** Hi, I'm Yijun and I work on UC Berkeley RTL's datahub project. I am excited to learn more about JupyterHub and engage with the JupyterHub community.
