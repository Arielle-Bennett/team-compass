    - [Edit this page buttons!](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/pull/577)
    - This was a big group effort from Kira, Stefan, Angus, and Franklin.
    - It was made much more possible by the scientific python workshop/summit, thanks for organizing that.
- There have been a ton of improvements to the MyST contributing guide, thanks Stefan for helping us test these out.
    - https://mystmd.org/guide/overview
    - These are not yet live but [here's the mega-PR](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2012) that adds the new concepts we wanted to cover.

:::spoiler Tools for breakouts, if required
- Cuckoo shared timer: https://cuckoo.team/jupyterhub-collab-cafe
:::

- [name=Kirstie] (10min): Intro to a Collaboration Cafe
- [name=Min] (5 min): Intro to JupyterHub
- [name=Angus] (2 min): Intro to Jupyter Book
- [name=Chris] (5 min): Connecting Jupyter projects
- [name=Chris] (5min): Chris wants to prime everybody to start thinking about technical, product, and team strategy for JupyterHub and Jupyter Book because we're going to trigger some of these conversations in Jupyter at-large.
    - [Here's the JEC issue](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/ec-team-compass/issues/118) describing this at a high level
- [name=Chris] (5min): Any objections to removing `/en/latest` from our team compass and switching to "folder-based" URLs instead? [ref issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/777)
        - Group agreed that making the URLS consistent and more easily read was a good move forwads
        - **Decision** - one more week to investigate a graceful transfer with no breaking links. After 27 May go ahead with "good enough" effort.
- [name=Samuel] (10m): Jupyter Buildpack
    - Buildpacks: Package a set of artifacts which will be used for a project. Started with Heroku (?), became open source. The tricky part: Deploying as a development environment where you may want more than one kernel to play with.
    - Output: A docker image allowing use of Jupyter in a controlled environment, as similar as possible to local machine (esp. dev environment).
    - Previously explored within repo2docker: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/issues/868
- [name=Samuel] (10m): repo2docker backed by pack
    - https://paketo.io/
- [name=Samuel] (10m): Amalthea for KubeSpawner
    - https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/
    - Amalthea is a K8s "operator": Allows creating pods that are jupyter server (JupyterLab session ready to use). Evolved to become more generic.
    - https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/issues/839
    - Use Amalthea operator in JupyterHub?
    - Help maintain and improve it.
    - Simon: How easy is it to maintain? How's the developer experience?
    - Samuel: Amalthea moved from Python -> Go. It reads YAML and generates k8s building blocks. Not overly hard to grasp/dive into. Does some optional things related to hibernation.
    - Min: Seems worthwhile to try replacing kubespawner with Amalthea.

### Check-in :raising_hand:

- Min / @minrk / Simula
- Raniere Silva / @rgaiacs / GESIS
- Samuel Gaist / @sgaist / Idiap Research Institute
- Erik Sundell / @consideRatio / Sundell Open Source Consulting AB
- Angus Hollands / @agoose77 / 2i2c

### Introduce yourself! :wave:

- `agoose77` — Hi all :wave:, I'm an OS Application Engineer at 2i2c, here on behalf of the Jupyter Book team. I'm joining these Collab Cafés following a suggestion from Kirstie Whitaker that the Jupyter Book team share this space: https://github.com/jupyter-book/team-compass/issues/20#issuecomment-2749522676

### Celebrations and Shout-Outs :tada:


- Simon did a great job setting up https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-container-images for publishing jupyterhub images. It will build our 5.3 release later today!
- new GESIS mybinder federation member on Hetzner!
- JupyterHub 5.3 release ready!
- github-activity 1.0 released, it is used in our release processes, no need to install from main branch any more

### Agenda :clock2:

- _[name=Erik] (10m): JupyterHub org to pilot GitHub org wide security configuration_
    - Working with the Jupyter Security Subproject, we have concluded it would be good to pilot if the "GitHub Recommended" org wide security configuration could be relevant to apply across all Jupyter's 16 active GitHub org's.
    - I propose JupyterHub takes the lead and pilots adoption of this security configuration, see https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/768.
    - Agenda item goal: to make a decision if/when to trial applying the GitHub recommended security configuration in our org in a "don't enforce" way.
- [name=Min] (5m): JupyterHub 5.3 release **today** https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/5048

Agenda finished early, so we tested enabling GitHub Recommened Security on jupyterhub/jupyterhub.
Conclusion was that we should _not_ enable this, due to the use of CodeQL (https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/102#issuecomment-2808850179),
but a _very similar_ security policy (e.g. identical minus CodeQL) ought to be fine.

### Celebrations and Shout-Outs :tada: 

- :speaking_head_in_silhouette: Thank you Yuvi for submitting a talk application to SciPy!

### Agenda :clock2: 

- Transferring some PyPI projects to Jupyter org
  - https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/763
  - https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/issues/524
  - Old issue about setting up a PyPI org: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/649
  - About adding people to the PyPI org: https://github.com/jupyter-governance/ec-team-compass/issues/101
- Connections between JupyterHub and Jupyter leadership

    - https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/os-support
    - https://github.com/jupyter-governance/jupyter-foundation-governing-board/issues/1
    - Discussion: supportive of developer in residence programme
        - Question: Do we want to have people full time or part time? 100%, 50%, 20% - does that help people to participate? EG folks who are already paid to work in the stack but free up some of their time 
        - Inspiration could come from: https://ev.kde.org/corporate/careers/
    - Remember that not everyone wants to be paid - there's a lot of uncertainty and work involved in setting up a business as a contractor
    - Gift economy vs market economy (return on investment)
    - General agreement that _not_ putting together an open process in this first year is the right choice
        - More important to spend the money quickly and experiment with what is going to be of benefit to the project / ecosystem as a whole.
- Voices of JupyterHub update
  - Report around 80% done - a few more interviews to conduct but writing happening.
  - Retreat booked for 4 & 5 June: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/761
      - Next steps identifying agenda
      - Funds for childcare and dinner available for remote participants.
      - Aiming for true hybrid discussion - meaning remote attendees participate with the in person attendees (not parallel conversations)

### Celebrations and Shout-Outs :tada:

- JupyterHealth is adopted as part of JupyterHub
- Lots of wonderful work on single-node members of mybinder federation by @yuvipanda and 2i2c

### Agenda :clock2:

Security-related work ideas in JupyterHub

- Related to @krassowski writing about security work funding [in Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/469744-jupyterhub/topic/Security.20training.20.28GitHub.20Secure.20Open.20Source.20Fund.29)

ideas:

- Enable PKCE ("pixie", /ˈpɪksi/) in JupyterHub
  - wip: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4936
  - Requires database schema change to store code_verifier, otherwise relatively simple. Client-side already implemented in OAuthenticator.
  - Enables OAuth without a client secret ("public client")
  - To be required in OAuth 2.1, but it's unclear when it is to be a thing
  - A client ID is required, and tied to a redirect URL
  - Tech overview [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)
- Explore JWT, JWKs instead of opaque access tokens
  - scopes in JWTs signed with JWKs could enable auth without Hub requests (still need revocation)
  - Caveats around dynamic scopes like `inherit` need consideration
- Refresh tokens, expiring token UX
  - JupyterHub should support refresh tokens
  - Improving JupyterLab UX of expiring/refreshing token
    would enable shorter expiration by default
- JupyterHub as OIDC provider
  - needs JWT, _maybe_ JWK
  - doesn't need full benefits of JWKs, though
- OIDCAuthenticator
  - no direct security benefit, but simplified deployment because
    OIDC specifies several configuration options derived from a single .well-known URL
- Security-focused testing
  - there is probably tools and practices to _verify_ security and authentication
  - for jupyterhub as an IdP, how do we verify that we implement OAuth2 correctly?
  - Are there best practices on testing OAuth2 functionality, specifically focused on ensuring we deny access correctly
