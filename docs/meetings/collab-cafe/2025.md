### Agenda :clock2:

Security-related work ideas in JupyterHub

- Related to @krassowski writing about security work funding [in Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/469744-jupyterhub/topic/Security.20training.20.28GitHub.20Secure.20Open.20Source.20Fund.29)

ideas:

- Enable PKCE ("pixie", /ˈpɪksi/) in JupyterHub
  - wip: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4936
  - Requires database schema change to store code_verifier, otherwise relatively simple. Client-side already implemented in OAuthenticator.
  - Enables OAuth without a client secret ("public client")
  - To be required in OAuth 2.1, but it's unclear when it is to be a thing
  - A client ID is required, and tied to a redirect URL
  - Tech overview [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)
- Explore JWT, JWKs instead of opaque access tokens
  - scopes in JWTs signed with JWKs could enable auth without Hub requests (still need revocation)
  - Caveats around dynamic scopes like `inherit` need consideration
- Refresh tokens, expiring token UX
  - JupyterHub should support refresh tokens
  - Improving JupyterLab UX of expiring/refreshing token
    would enable shorter expiration by default
- JupyterHub as OIDC provider
  - needs JWT, _maybe_ JWK
  - doesn't need full benefits of JWKs, though
- OIDCAuthenticator
  - no direct security benefit, but simplified deployment because
    OIDC specifies several configuration options derived from a single .well-known URL
- Security-focused testing
  - there is probably tools and practices to _verify_ security and authentication
  - for jupyterhub as an IdP, how do we verify that we implement OAuth2 correctly?
  - Are there best practices on testing OAuth2 functionality, specifically focused on ensuring we deny access correctly

### Introductions

- **Kirstie** Not really new to the meeting but a new job for 2025 - I'm now the executive director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, working with Fernando Perez as Faculty Director. We're VERY excited about contributing into the Jupyter ecosystem :rocket: 
- **Arielle** Hi, I'm Arielle, senior researcher for open source practices at Turing. Interested in looking at open source contributions, communities, and technical support. I also contribute to The Turing Way which has close links with Jupyter! 
- **Maryam** Hi, I'm Maryam, and I serve as the CTHO at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), working very closely with Fernando Perez. I'm also the Managing Director of Agile Metabolic Health Inititave at UC Berkeley College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), developing JupyterHealth which is being considered to be a subproject of JupyterHub (VERY exciting). We're thrilled about the opportunity to become more involved and contribute to the JupyterHub ecosystem moving forward.
- **Yijun** Hi, I'm Yijun and I work on UC Berkeley RTL's datahub project. I am excited to learn more about JupyterHub and engage with the JupyterHub community.

### Celebrations and Shout-Outs :tada: 

- https://2i2c.mybinder.org/
- Simon Li (@manics) has done a lot of work related to ARM64 and IPv6!
- If you're on the JupyterHub Steering Council don't forget to vote in the Executive Council 2025 Election
- Yuvi, Min, Simon, Chris, Sylvain for handling OVH mybinder.org outage and working towards a cost effective new strategy!
- Kirstie: Massive shout out to Sarah for stepping in to host when I had terrible internet problems!

    - To be approved/merged: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/pull/755
- **Yuvi** 10min: 2i2c mybinder federation member

#### Voices of JupyterHub

* Update from Dan
* Please send recommendations of people who have stopped contributing to the community - really important cohort to learn from
* What are the skills that someone needs to move from being a contributor to a maintainer
* Expression of Interest for interviews https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ7cpwtDOPd2paYkU4gy60hwxXUxw-Nk1xa7Qu_MrBTfZeNA/viewform?usp=sf_link 
* Repo for the project: https://github.com/the-turing-way/jupyterhub-orgmyc-EOSS
    * Issues welcome! Topics we should cover, feedback on desired outputs, etc.
    * Results will also be published here, ongoing
* Targeting mid-February for end of interviews and preliminary results

#### Renku / Amalthea operator

* Early access opportunity for 2.0! 
* Allows a few more user interface options
    * https://renkulab.io/
    * https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku
    * https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea

#### JupyterHealth

* Issue: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/752
* Pull request: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/pull/755
* Recommendation from Samuel: https://www.chorus-tre.ch
    * Might be using Jupyter?
    * Work in a similar / overlapping area
* Also connect to Simon for work in SATRE and UK TRE community
    * https://satre-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    * https://www.uktre.org/en/latest/

#### 2i2c joining BinderHub Federation

* Update from Yuvi
* Blog post coming soon from 2i2c
* 2i2c hub are in the federation and taking some traffic! 
    * PR: (KW not sure how to find)
* Can we reduce the technological and social costs - and the literal finanical costs! - to build up the BinderHub Federation
* Kirstie - hand up to be involved in brainstorming how to promote the value of the Federation and why it is important to contribute into open
