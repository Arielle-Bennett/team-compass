### Check-in

- Min / @minrk / Simula
- Samuel / @sgaist / Idiap Research Institute
- Simon / @manics / University of Dundee
- Raniere / @rgaiacs / GESIS
- Erik / @consideRatio / 2i2c

### Agenda

- **Min** (15m): user-initiated sharing [PR is complete and ready for review](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4594)
  - key points for review:
    - architecture overview
    - permissions
    - defaults
    - pydantic v2 dependency
  - questions:
    - samuel: is a share-code single use or usable multiple times to grant users permissions?
      - min: its re-usable, and state is kept on how many times its used.
      - samuel: it would be a relevant feature to let a share code be usable once and only once
      - min: current inclination is to not provide once-use codes yet, but its not that hard to support
    - erik: when this is released, what a implication?
      - admins: enabling sharing
      - users: tricky but possible to generate share links
      - min: reference + tutorial + example is provided
    - erik: review scrutiny
      - review in scopes.py file is relevant to ensure stability, there is some refactoring related to "has scopes" which is used in "am i allowed" handlers.
      - there is now public api where it was previously private
      - min: besides this, there is review of relevance about granularity of scope and missing features
- **Min** (15m): JupyterHub 5 planning
  - PRs awaiting review:
    - [/hub/info endpoint](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4442)
    - [public_url config](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4479)
    - [oauth improvement](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4608)
    - [user sharing](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4594)
    - (the prs can be reviewed separately, where /hub/info should be at least reviewed by Yuvi who requested the feature)
  - Features implemented, awaiting release:
  -
- **Min** (10m): Security discussion
- **Samuel** (10m): repo2podman ignore file management
  - PRs awaiting reviews
    - [ignore file support](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1205)
    - [extra ignore file support](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1325)
    - Points that needed some clarifications:
      - The ignore files are to be used at the Docker level and not repo2docker itself
      - The goal is to make repo2docker work in a similar fashion to podman and docker where files listed there will not be sent to the context and thus not part of the image
    - Possible issues:
      - May current repository break if these files are now being actively used ? It's likely going to be a rare case.
      - The documentation should be improved to make clear that the ignore file do not apply to repo2docker itself.
- **Simon** (3m) BinderHub versioning
  - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/1797>
  - CalVer is hard to get out of: <https://jacobtomlinson.dev/posts/2023/sometimes-i-regret-using-calver/>
  - EffVer! <https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/>
- **Erik** (3m) Z2JH breaking change merged requiring k8s 1.24+, and in end of january also k8s 1.25+ - I'm thinking we wait for jupyterhub 5 and focus on getting it out.
