* [name=myname] My update!
* [name=Chico Venancio] ECR and CodeCommit work done, (PRs [#920](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/920) [#940](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/940)). Current work on autosaving conflict with BinderHub.
* [name=Tim] we now support different R versions in repo2docker

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

* [name=myname] My report!
* [name=Tim] [name=Kenan] [name=Sarah] [name=Erik] Thanks for the awesome workshop Min!
* [name=Sarah] I think the BinderHub workshop at RSE Con UK went well. See feedback here: bit.ly/RSEConBinderHub
* [name=Tim] Thank you Sarah for all the work representing Binder at RSE Con UK by running a workshop and giving a talk and giving a lightning talk and taking the time to go to the event in the first place!


## Agenda items

This is what we'll cover in the meeting (we have about 60m in total). We'll copy the proposed agenda topics above here just before the meeting.

* Add agenda item here [name, estimated time for conversation]
* Report from the workshop, all those who attended
    * notes and linked pads: https://hackmd.io/a2i1WfvmTJW4RJJeCrwdYA
    * we worked and discussed ([summary pad](https://hackmd.io/N-uffNhvRdOgt1OvTuoq5w)):
        * documentation
            * create a "Hub for managers" guide
            * started "jupyterhub the hard way" tutorial
        * BinderHub UI
            * mobile friendly, get inspiration from PyPI
            * material UI as visual toolkit?
        * repo2docker PR triage fest
            * dealt with old PRs ðŸŽ‰
        * BinderHub-button-for-GKE
            * one click deployment!!
        * Discussed persistent BinderHub
            * GESIS have a working demo!
        * Azure pipelines v1 for repo2docker
        * Recognised the need for "start a binder from an expired binder session"
            * ideas for how to do it, difficulty level "tricky"
        * Many Z2JH PRs viability discussed, as documented [in issues](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+PR+Discussion+author%3Aconsideratio)
        * some called it "The annual workshop" ;)
    * [name=Kirstie]: What was the biggest thing that the team _didn't_ get to at the workshop?
        * Didn't get to release some of the packages - there are a few that are ready to go but we didn't get to that.
        * The changelog is kind of a blocker on this - a clearer process on what is needed for a release would make this easier.
            * Would be cool to make it clearer for people who aren't working from master _what will change_ when they update to a new release. 
        * (Kirstie: As a bit of background on this question: I think its often hard to balance the high level discussions and the actual "doing" of things like updating code etc. I'm planning a sprint for a different project at the moment and I can feel these tensions in the planning!)
            * focussing on discussions of particular issues, clearing old PRs, and then discussing small bits of code was nice (Tim)
* Share your canned responses, Tim, 10minutes
    * GitHub lets each user have "prepared responses" for issues and threads
    * we often have to reply to similar issues (wrong repo, needs more details, out of scope, angry user, welcome a user, is this PR stalled, etc)
    * At the team meeting in Oslo we discovered that people already have cheat sheets that they use
    * I'd be interested in creating a team cheat sheat that all of us can crib from to reduce the effort required (especially for tricky situations)
      * [name=Sarah] "Unfortunately, mybinder.org doesn't support `FEATURE`, but you can enable this by deploying your own BinderHub! `link to docs`" 
  * Tim will create a hackmd and start adding ones he uses, others welcoms, others welcome to add theirs and reuse them
  * Maybe not copy&paste each response but customise it when you use it
      * add your own touch to it and maybe also customise it when you use it for that particular situation

* Gesis joining the Binder federation (Tim)
    * deployment not from mybinder.org-deploy
    * use a bot to keep up to date (similar to henchbot)
    * assign gesis.mybinder.org as sub-domain
    * @bitnik as contact person
    * currently at 1% of mybinder.org traffic
        * goal capacity?
        * [name=Kenan] 1% -> 5% -> 10% -> 20%
    * [name=Kenan] We should remove or bring to the default buttons in Noteboook UI, right?
        * one thing to work on is to make them work better on mobile
        * maybe implement them as a Jupyter extension instead of via repo2docker appendix
    * decision
        * probably yes
    * [name=Erik] Question: will the user experience be remain similar?
      * Important that the experience for visitors to mybinder.org is seamless - don't want them to have different usage experiences depending on where they're assigned.
      * There's a minor customisation at the moment, but agree that there's a little difference (buttons in top right corner of notebook, see above)
      * how do we keep the instances in sync?
          * repo2docker updates are straight forward
          * BinderHub updates are easy but major changes (in particular HTML templates) take some time
          * if a member of the federation is "too far behind" we automatically stop sending traffic
    * Test: https://notebooks-test.gesis.org

* Turing joining the Binder federation (Tim)
    * deployment from mybinder.org-deploy
    * assign turing.mybinder.org and hub.turing.mybinder.org (for jhub)
    * @sgibson91 as contact person
    * start off with 1% of traffic to debug then ramp up
        * goal capacity?([name=Sarah] 10-20%?)
          * [name=Kirstie] I think following the Gesis plan should work :smile: 
          * 1% -> 5% -> 10% -> 20%
          * We have a budget of $10,000 for the next year. I think if we can show good usage and impact we would be able to find some more in the future.
    * decision
        * probably yes
    * [name=Kirstie]: What comms should we have for this?
      * The Turing comms team would like very much to be involved and they tend to need a decent amount of lead time.
      * Will we do a flying under the radar start off? And then launch once we've figured out some bugs?
      * a "launch event" would be good for Binder, Turing, etc in terms of attention, 
      * a blog post on the jupyter blog
      * Turing will have their own but their post will be very short
    * [name=Kirstie] Re:comms - I think its useful to think about _why_ we want to have these comms - for Turing it's definitely showing that they're investing in the most innovative and exciting data science. For Jupyter I think it might be about bringing in more contributors? More operators? More users? Money :moneybag:? What about for Gesis?
        * Tim thinks this is a very good input!
        * Kirstie's happy to hack on this in a side channel (issue, hackmd) :smile_cat: 
    * Our application for funding, for reference: https://hackmd.io/SxF25aeRRCS1ZptyShYxtg?view#Research-Justification

* [Eventlogging](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/2698) in JupyterHub. Min to the rescue :smiley: (THANK YOU!!!) [name=Zach, 5 min] 
    * Merge?
    * ~~Came across a confusing [issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/2698) in JupyterHub tests:~~
        * ~~unit tests affect each other; maybe not properly torn down?~~
        * ~~`MockHub` instances are the likely culprit.~~
* [Hubshare](https://github.com/jupyterhub/hubshare) - 10min.
    * Should we move forward with this project?
        * Mixed signal across issues in HubShare. 
            1. Implement HubShare using WebDAV for storage and a REST API on top. [hubshare#12](https://github.com/jupyterhub/hubshare/issues/12)
            2. Just use other existing tools. [hubshare#14](https://github.com/jupyterhub/hubshare/issues/14) 
    * Explored using WebDAV for storage API (see [this branch](https://github.com/Zsailer/hubshare/tree/webdav-storage)).
    * Question: What is the decision process for this? How do we balance time on this vs time on something else?
      * In general, its a very cool idea!
      *  
    * Unhelpful comment: (Kirstie likes the current README comment "Important: This repo is in early development (it doesn't work)." :laughing:)
