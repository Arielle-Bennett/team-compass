## Quick updates

60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

* [name=Sarah] The Turing Federation cluster is very close to being merged! I just want to check that I've done the "right thing" for connecting it to the grafana dashboard, then I think we're good to go! :sparkling_heart:
    * **UPDATE:** It's now merged!!! https://turing.mybinder.org
* [name=Georgiana] Things went great these two first weeks. I wanted to boost my confidence a bit so I focused mostly on the things I was most familliar with (some dev and issue answering in TLJH). [Here is a link with a more detailed report](https://hackmd.io/qFUIYSONTouaDLuwN112IA?view). The progress report structure that focuses on the KPIs is still a work in progress and will try to finish it in the upcoming week.
* Check out the 2019 Binder retrospective! https://blog.jupyter.org/a-2019-retrospective-from-the-binder-project-57a449517362?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------
* Check out the pydata bootstrap theme, we now use it! https://github.com/pandas-dev/pydata-bootstrap-sphinx-theme

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

* [name=Sarah] I've been awarded a Fellowship from the Software Sustainability Institute! :tada: :tada: :tada:
  * https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-01-10-announcing-2020-software-sustainability-institute-fellows
  * I hope to use my Fellowship to do some more advocating for Binder, particularly in the Julia and R communities and smooth the on boarding ramp for them becoming maintainers
  * You can see my application video on my blog post: https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/
  * Thanks to everyone in this community who have supported me through joining the team and the application process. And a special thanks to Carol W for agreeing to be my mentor over the course of the Fellowship. I'm really excited for what this year will bring!
* Many thanks to @manics who debugged the R language issues over the holidays that Sarah mentioned

## Agenda items

This is what we'll cover in the meeting (we have about 60m in total). We'll copy the proposed agenda topics above here just before the meeting.

* Alex and Meredith would like to use mybinder.org for a Physics undergrad course[Tim, 10-15min]
    * short introductions from everyone
    * what are their plans
    * about 800 students in terms of load?
        * main use "out of class"
        *
    * what experience do we have with large classes? How many actually try to use mybinder.org simultaneously?
    * how do we keep the service usable by everyone?
    * how do we make it happen?
        * Erik/@consideratio is happy to provide guidance regarding deploying a JupyterHub on the cloud. I'm motivated to help universities to improve educational experiences. If this becomes relevant, feel free to reach out to me at erik.i.sundell@gmail.com, Gitter, GitHub, or discourse.jupyter.org.
    * questions:
        * iFrame-ability?
    * Ideas and suggestions:
        * instead of using mybinder.org you can run your own BinderHub or JupyterHub
        * JupyterHub is the thing to use if you have a small number of courses
            * https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
            * https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/
        * BinderHub is the thing to use if you have many many different courses
            * https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    * A few tools that might be useful for you

            * This is one for a ~1,500 student course: https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro
            * Chris is happy to chat about the tech stack etc behind these @ Berkeley
