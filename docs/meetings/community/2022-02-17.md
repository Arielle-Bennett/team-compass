## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- **Min:** Authorization [landed](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/pull/165) in Jupyter Server, Identity API [under review](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/pull/671)

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **manics (5m):** [BinderHub auto-formatting](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1381)
  - pre-commit with some default plugins is in use across
  - PR has been open for a long time, no strong objections
  - while disruptive for existing PRs, most open PRs have been open for a long time
  - question: can we roll out pre-commit now?
    - sounds like yes and we have a plan for helping PR authors that end up conflicts
- **manics (10m):** [New mybinder member](https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/issues/1772)
  - KAUST (King Adbulla University of Science and Technology) has an internal JupyterHub and BinderHub as well as being a heavy user of mybinder.org
  - Have spare hardware that they'd like to donate
  - looking for help and guidance on how we could move forward
  - two options regarding "joining the federation": (1) hand over access control to the cluster to mybinder.org-deploy (automatic deployment/Binder team takes care of it) and (2) GESIS style (federation member manages everything)
    - Option (1) should work for everyone
  - Binder team takes care of BinderHub deployments and updates, KAUST can take care of node level updates and k8s updates
  - Think about where to store docker images, OVH for example run Harbour as a local container registry
    - docker hub is getting less and less good as a registry
  - Q: What kubernetes distribution is used? A: [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/)
  - What do to next?? -> next steps will be documented and discussed in the linked GitHub issue
- **Min (10m):** custom scopes and tokens revealing issues with assigning roles to tokens: <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/3713>
  - sample app: grader service wants to get different permissions for different users
  - jupyterhub currently requires tokens to have a subset of their owner's permissions when created
  - tokens are assigned permissions via _roles_ not scopes directly, so can change permission relative to owner over time. This also means scope-level _partial_ permission can't be done in a way that sticks.
- **Samuel (10m):** BinderHub/JupyterHub auth state debugging
  - Where to look for ?
    - auth_state and oauth_state are different beasts
  - Are there any known catch that could be documented ?
    - LDAP login and OAuth login do not follow the same flow hence the auth_state setup might be more tricky in the second case.
    - Ensure that the URLs used do match because there are callbacks for both JupyterHub and BinderHub which are different and will get the data to be rejected
    - If doing local tests localhost and 127.0.0.1 are going to be seen as different hosts even if pointing to the same service
