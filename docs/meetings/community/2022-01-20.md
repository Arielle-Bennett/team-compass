60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

- **Min:** exploring an EU proposal for Binder-related work for reproducibility in science [horizon-widera-2022-era-01-41](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-widera-2022-era-01-41)
- **Isabela:** We have upcoming Jupyter accessibility workshops this Saturday ([more info on the Jupyter blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/join-us-for-the-jupyter-accessibility-workshops-part-1-133e0e522d1b)) and in March. This is open to everyone and intended to increase accessibility knowlege and connections in the community.

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

  - [Code from demo](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea-jupyterhub-demo)
- **Min (10m):** Extending scopes to Jupyter Server, RTC
  - Custom scopes (JupyterHub): <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/3713>

  - Questions:
    - Will there be support for groups of users as well?
      - Yes, the RBAC that exists now should already support this

  - <https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-multicluster-kubespawner>
