## II. Team News and Informational items

*News items you want to share with others (partnerships, important conversations, design considerations, something fun, something that annoyed you). If you have it, please link to a GitHub issue)*

*Let's keep items brief, preferably in bullet form (action verb, links, people). Example:  Meet Tim's long lost rich relative to fund mybinder.org Links (Tim, Aunt B, interested team members)*

- First video call for the team is scheduled. [Details](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/10)
- Chatted with Sylvain + Loic in France, they're interested in a JupyterHub for French unis.
    - French HPC/Loic have spent some effort in setting up something that looks very much like binder, interested in maybe using binder/jupyterhub
    - Hosting on OVH (something like google cloud/AWS but more Euro).
    - Some 'JupyterHub federation' similar to berkeley MOOC work
- Prepared a draft blog post (blog.jupyter.org) for the MyBinder browser extension.
    - try to avoid conflicts with other posts
    - to get a list of other posts ask steering council/mailing list to find out what other sub-projects are doing
    - raise as an issue on the weekly Jupyter meeting under communications (Carol)

### Organization highlights

*Communications, Social Media, Conferences, Outreach*

- [Reaching out to JOSS](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/issues/360) **COMPLETED**
  - Tim is reviewing a paper and will mention that it would have been nice to have a binder link
- Ask eLife if they want to fund a project to integrate with binder for their "archive to GitHub" idea?
  - https://github.com/elifesciences-publications
  - https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/dbcb6949/forking-software-used-in-elife-papers-to-github
  - Tim will send a short email to Naomi to see what they think
- Jupyter Days event coming up in March in France.
    - Conversation with Sylvain and Loic
    - Date early March (5th??)
    - 300 to 500 attendees
    - Prepare a blog post annouce (ask Sylvain)
    - Chris might be in the area, Min will probably go, who else is interested?
- JupyterCon CFP website online (restricted access) let's not try to cram blog post too close to the CFP annouce.
- Hackathon with Data Carpentry at BIDS next week (Jan 9th and 10th), Chris H will work on Binder teaching material.

### BinderHub projects

*BinderHub, mybinder-deploy, helm charts, binder-examples*

- Security update for meltdownattack.com performed (Thanks Yuvi)
- Prod cluster scaled down to 3 nodes and switched from n1-standard class nodes (equal CPU + memory ratio) to n1-highmem (more memory than CPU) based on our usage metrics (as part of meltdownattack.com fix)
- npm refactor merged (yay @minrk! @rgbrk & other nteract folks)
- playground.mybinder.org now redirects to play.nteract.io (yay cross-promotion) (this was down for Chris H today. Others? (is down for me too, should check with nteract folks)) I just checked again and it's back up - CH
    - Works for Matthias, Tim, Chris. Is that exectuing on same machines as MyBinder.org ? (nope it's not)
- Working on fixing binder badge being blocked by privacy badger (https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/379)
    - our badge.svg is served from same host as some cookies we set which triggers a tracking warning
    - now served from static.mybinder.org/badge.svg but apparently still triggers warning
    - how to respect DNT headers?
    - fix that the GA cookies is set on `*.mybinder.org` not just the top domain
- Loading page PR is almost ready (https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/384)
    - this is better than watching a washing machine
    - Looks like Tony Stark Visor in his Iron Man suit.
    - Matthias has one concern about css animations power draining.
- Chris H will give a go at the BinderHub setup instructions w/ a more recent dev version to make sure they're still correct.
- Matthias will rebase the [Federation PR.](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/274) Thoughs on it ?
    - lots of details to work out, but let's label it as a prototype
    - how do we keep versions in sync, how to handle when they are out-of-sync, etc
    - do we create a separate prototype service from mybinder.org
    - look into what the grant covers related to federation
    - which privacy policies apply when on a federated deployment
    - vision for federation blog post to see what others think?
        - make sure users see who is providing the CPU to them
    - step 1 before pushing the federation idea is to start having good releases that users can rely on
- More eyes on this deployment process proposal https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/issues/225

### Related projects

*repo2docker, nbgrader, others*

- part of making a repo2docker release a pypi account was created (mybinderteam), ask Tim to share password/login via lastpass if you are interested. It should be connected to the gmail account as well. ([#136](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/issues/136#issuecomment-343586238))
- sphinx-gallery PR is now merged https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/244
    - huge PR!
    - can we reuse a running pod for the same user instead of launching a new one?
        - there is an issue somewhere on exactly this topic, add link

## III. Discussion items and Questions

*Items that you wish to raise for team input. Include Project Name.*
- Binder vs binderhub issues? How do we distinguish where an issue goes?
    - check out and improve the https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
    - proposal:
        - binder is for users
        - binderhub is about the software

### Open PRs



### Open issues
