## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- [name=Yuvi] Happy that Erik is doing cleanup to bring a bunch of our repos up to standard (LTIAuthenticator, Simpervisor, nbgitpuller)

## Agenda items

    - Next month's meeting is scheduled to happen on 20th December. This is very close to when many of us in the northern hemisphere will be taking leave for the winter break. I propose we cancel this meeting and meet again in the new year.
