## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting (**closing time 24h before**). We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them already.

* Resources definitions/requests by the repository creator or repository launcher, following up on December 2018 [name=@jhamman]
    * relevant issues: https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/731, https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/759, https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/712
    * Relevant questions
        * What resource fields do we need?
            * Can use the Kubernetes docs as a reference (since ultimately we'll be passing the values of these fields to k8s)
    * check if we can read docker image LABELs without pulling the image? If yes then storing resource requests in the repo and repo2docker will store it in LABELs
    * Q from Craig: Why encode things in the URL parameter, why not allow them to be encoded in the repository itself (e.g., so an author could define the resources needed for a repo to run)
        * The URL parameter stuff wouldn't preclude this from being possible - one idea is to let authors store this in the repository, and set some kind of "defaults" in the built docker image than could be *overridden* by URL parameters.

* Rust End of year thoughts/what is next style process, see https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/end-of-year-thoughts-from-the-rust-community/295/7?u=betatim
    * propose to create a post on the discourse forum asking for blogs/tweets/gists/replies for the next four(?) weeks which then get compiled into the Binder Roadmap for the next 12months. [name=@betatim]
    * When would we start this? 
        * Maybe after dev meeting in March.
    * Make it clear that this is about getting input and ideas, taking the temperature, not about formal proposals and deliverables
    * How do we collect suggestions from the many different mediums?
        * Use discourse as the primary list and allow others to link to their ideas from there.
    * Reach out to the Rust community to ask for adivce on mechanics and such
        * Tim contacts Luiz Irber (Determine time to produce, resources that did the work re: paid/volunteer)
    * If you don't have a highly structured format for such ideas, it becomes difficult to evaluate suggestions from the community. Maybe suggest a format/questions to make it easier to digest?

* JupyterHub Helm Chart v 0.8 [nearly ready to go](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+milestone%3A0.8) [name=@choldgraf]
    * Has been about 7 months since last release
    * Only remaining issue is to find a list of the JupyterHub versions for each helm chart. Does anybody know this? (https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/1094)
    * Need to update the change log.
    * Anything else to be done?

* (no need to discuss) Chris would like help putting together a "how to spot a bitcoin miner" page in the SRE guide. He opened an issue to put together a list of tips (https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/issues/879)
    * +100 Tim plans to write what he knows in the PR with the "find high CPU pods and processes"

* (no need to discuss) Chris would like help finishing the BinderHub@NeurIPS post: https://hackmd.io/ZEVbmiWHQiOuRUQzRmjnNg?edit

* Graphics, diagrams, drawings, "zines"
    * Tim is commissioning work to help explain what Binder is, how to use it, etc +100
    * Will probably select a small agency in Germany based on recommendations
    * They will pitch a concept mid February
    * Ideas for what kind of artefacts would be useful for the project welcome
    * Need to figure out how to integrate this into the normal GitHub based workflow. I don't think they've ever worked with an open-source project like us.
        * Figma, is like sketch but web-based good for collaborating and reviewing work
    * Cool binder drawing: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dwe4jVdU0AA2Ss-.jpg:large
    * Apparently figma and slack paid the same design firm for their logo :-)
        * ![](https://i.imgur.com/LI1VgZs.png)
        * ![](https://i.imgur.com/F9vZuVC.png)
    * Three one pagers 
        * architecture and ecosystem for JupyterHub
        * architecture and ecosystem for BinderHub
        * how does it work and ecosystem for mybinder.org

* repo2docker.version PR check-in - Craig
    * Is there anything useful to discuss that isn't covered on Github?
    * https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/pull/550
    * use local repo2docker to fetch source
    * local repo2docker starts a containerised repo2docker-in-specified-version with a local directory content provider
    

Items added after the cut-off will be in the "bonus material" section. We will go through the ordinary agenda items first and then cover bonus items if the clock hasn't run out.


## Reports

Things people should know about.

* Cost per student for Berkeley's hub (of 4.5k students) is between 1$ / month / user to 2$ / month / user based on how active a student is before you consider them a 'user'. Open (anonymized) data + cool graphs at https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub-usage-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/03-visualize-cost-and-usage.ipynb. Mean daily active users is 1006 students! (Yuvi)
    * how does the cost scale if your cluster has less users?
        * if I only have 100 students, do I still only pay $1 per student or more because there are "fixed" costs
* Yuvi working on getting Space Telescope Sciences Institute to buy out some of his time at Berkeley to focus more on JupyterHub / BinderHub
* RStudio has explicitly granted us trademark permission on mybinder.org

Our next meeting is **February 21st, 2019** at 6pm Zurich time.
