* https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/61 - should we adopt 'third thursday of the month' as regular slot for the meetings?

    * What messages do we want to send?

    * after registering email Jess with the email you used
* internal ssl: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/2055
    * needs support from spawners
    * help test it out!
    * do services get the SSL things they need? (Todo reminder for Min)
* entrypoints for custom classes: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/2203
    * entrypoints are how pytest plugins and pygme lexer extensions work
    * your package can register yourself as "kubernetes" spawner
    * the hub can then ask for the package that provides the "kubernetes" spawner
    * very nice benefit is that jupyterhub can generate config options for all 'plugins'!
    * standalone package called 'entrypoints' used at runtime (written Thomas)
* simplify binderhub helm chart:  https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/680
* How do we make it easier for other BinderHubs to be in sync with mybinder.org?
    * start regular releases of repo2docker
    * "so you want to run a BinderHub?" - create docs that help you make choices when running a BinderHub
    * what in mybinder.org-deploy should be promoted to the BinderHub chart
        * for example network policies
        * make the default network policy more like Yuvi's EdX deployment with HTTPS proxy and SNI inspection?
* Good work being done on the Outreachy mentoring :D ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
* jhubctl (WIP): common CLI for deploying jupyterhub on any provider
    * pronounced "hub-cuddle", it is a silent j
