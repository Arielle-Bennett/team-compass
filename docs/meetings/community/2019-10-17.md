## Agenda items

This is what we'll cover in the meeting (we have about 60m in total). We'll copy the proposed agenda topics above here just before the meeting.

* Add agenda item here [name, estimated time for conversation]
* Jupyter Governance changes [name=Tim] (X minutes)
    * details needed from Tim (check forum thread for details)
    * several threads including lots of new ones this morning
    * if you are interested in governance get yourself involved!

* mybinder.org cloud credits contingency [name=Tim]
    * what should we do if we run out of GKE credits?
    * https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/214 related discussion issue
    * top repos by launches (look at timestamp column)
        * https://files.gitter.im/betatim/l975/thumb/Screenshot-2019-10-01-at-07.41.06.png
        * launches per repo in the 120 days leading up to 2019-10-01
    * Ideas:
        * give less resources to repositories that are used mostly to "just look"
            * will only work if we are limited by memory not number of pods per node
            * need to stick to highmem-8 nodes on GKE
        * TODO: What node types are used across the federation (pods per node limit, memory and CPU)?
            * this will help determine resource limits.
            * Turing: Standard_D4s_v3 nodes, 4 vCPU, 16 GB
        * TODO: implement per repo resource limits
        * TODO: try out what happens during a version bump when capacity will reduce briefly
        * Investigate mechanisms to make the "don't send traffic" more granular for version mismatches
        * TODO: what are the special services we run on GKE that can't easily move?

* MS Azure Portal walkthrough [name=Sarah] (10 mins) 
    * Tim asked me if I could do a short introduction to the Azure Portal for managing an Azure-hosted BinderHub
    * Would anyone want a longer meeting for more questions?
    * Docker Bot for Azure: https://github.com/HelmUpgradeBot/DockerCleanUp
    * can we setup a shared docker registry that is shared amongst all clusters in the federation?
    * add option to configure federation members to only opt-in to "high traffic" repositories

* Software Sustainability Insitute 2020 Fellowship application run-through [name=Sarah] (10 mins)
    * I've decided to [apply](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) to do something Binder related and the application involves a 6 minute screen-cast presentation.
    * Looks like we may not have time for this so here's the link to the PR with the script for my presentation, a link to the slides is at the top of the markdown file: https://github.com/sgibson91/ssi-fellowship/pull/1

* Releasing JupyterHub 1.1 [name=min]
