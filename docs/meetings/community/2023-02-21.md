## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **Min** (2m): JupyterHub 4.0 beta <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/4350>
  - Made some fixes to address some frustrations
  - Small major release, there are some other things but not critical
  - Try to get the docs in shape, but can do a beta release without for now
- **Richard Alcock** (10m): Jupyter Server Proxy on Windows
  - MathWorks is interested in Windows support in jupyter-server-proxy to support of MATLAB kernel. Would like to discuss the best approaches to working on this.
  - MatLab kernel relies on jupyter-server-proxy
  - kernel talks to matlab via server proxy
  - can also launch matlab web IDE via server proxy
  - Testing on Windows critical, for PR and future - GH Actions make this easier
    - Get unit/integration tests to pass on Windows
    - Tests might not cover MATLAB cases, may need new
    - Get Yuvi in the loop, who reviewed previous PR
    - asyncio subprocess may have improved in last 2 years - still unstable/unreliable on Windows
    - proactor vs selector eventloop complicate things for asyncio subprocess support on Windows
    - subprocess-based approach like kernels may be the easiest way to be cross-platform
  - See <https://github.com/jupyterhub/simpervisor/issues/6> and <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/pull/181>
- **Simon** (10m): 3 JupyterHub repositories submitted to the Jupyter Security vulnerability scanning programme
  - EU funding to evaluate open source security
  - JupyterHub
  - zero-to-jupyterhub
  - kubespawner
  - could spin up a deployment for them to test with, if we have somewhere we can deploy. Do we have that? Maybe 2i2c?
    - Email hello@2i2c.org
  - Relevant to jupyterhub 4 beta, which has security changes
- **Simon** (10m): BinderHub with AWS ECR
  - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/1623>
  - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1637>
    - In trying to set this up for the federation, Erik and Sarah discovered that the image repo had to exist in the registry _before_ pushing, which is currently a unique situation and not covered <https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/2467#issuecomment-1405338819> (this is being addressed)
    - tokens expire after a few hours, so we have to request new tokens for each build
    - currently implemented as microservice
    - microservice vs Python API: Python API requires rebuilding/custom BinderHub image, microservice deployed/upgraded separately
    - Maybe split PR to just the time-limited token support for now
- Other potential topics?
  - LTI13: support or drop? <https://github.com/jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator/issues/127>
  - Some more love for traefik proxy?
    - now supports traefik v2
    - needs some backward-compatibility work to fix some changes for v2 to be less breaking
    - needs activity-tracking before it can be merged into z2jh, which should be feasible via metrics
    - simplest path to z2jh will be to swap into chp as-is, and _not_ merge with existing autohttps traefik instance
    - seem to be issues with unmaintained consul and etcd clients
